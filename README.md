Senior Mobile Software Engineer specializing in iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) and Flutter, with a strong focus on building scalable, production-grade applications.

Currently building high-quality mobile and web applications (iOS / Android / Web) with AI integration and modern cloud-based architectures.

I have 3+ years of hands-on experience developing and maintaining complex mobile systems for large enterprise clients, including global brands, working on products used by thousands of users under strict performance, reliability, and security requirements.

Beyond client work, I actively build and ship my own products - including AI-powered and data-driven applications - to deepen my technical skills, explore new technologies, and gain full end-to-end ownership from architecture to deployment.

My strengths lie in clean architecture, thoughtful UX, performance optimization, and turning complex requirements into robust, maintainable software. I’m especially interested in systems that combine mobile, backend, and intelligent features to create meaningful, real-world impact.
